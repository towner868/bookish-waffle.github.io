Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Per the exercise N sizes, predictions leveled out @ N == 10,000.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

1500 is a pretty good statistical rule of thumb.
